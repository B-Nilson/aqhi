Version: 0.9.0
Authors@R: person("Brayden", "Nilson", email = "nilson.brayden@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"))
Description: Calculate the Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and the AQHI+ modification in both English and French. 
    AQHI is formulated from 3-hour rolling mean fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), while AQHI+ uses only 1-hour mean PM2.5.  
    AQHI+ overrides AQHI by default if higher for a given hour.
    AQHI colours, associated risk levels, and health messaging can be produced individually.
